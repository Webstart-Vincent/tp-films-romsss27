                        During the 1980s, a failed stand-up comedian is driven
                        insane and turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham
                        City while becoming an infamous psychopathic crime
                        figure.

                        who also has the ability to "shine." He tries to protect
                        her from the True Knot, a cult whose goal is to feed off
                        of people like them in order to remain immortal.
